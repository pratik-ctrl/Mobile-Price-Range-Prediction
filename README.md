# Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction

Chart 1: 

The specific chart used in the provided code snippet is a pie chart. A pie chart is chosen to represent the distribution of the price range categories in the dataset. Here's why the pie chart was selected. 

Visualizing distribution: A pie chart is an effective way to visualize the distribution of categorical data. 

The chart visually represents the distribution of mobile phones across different price ranges. The labels indicate the categories of price ranges, which are 'Low Cost', 'Medium Cost', 'High Cost', and 'Very High Cost'. 

the chart provides an overview of the distribution of mobile phones across different price ranges, allowing viewers to quickly understand the relative proportions of low, medium, high, and very high-cost mobile phones in the dataset. 

companies can set optimal prices for their products. This can help them remain competitive in the market and attract customers. 

the dataset can help in identifying different customer segments based on their preferred price range. 

 

Chart2: 

1. Box plots have been used to show the distribution of continuous variables (battery power, internal memory, RAM, screen height, screen width, pixel resolution height, and pixel resolution width) across different price ranges. Box plots provide a quick and easy way to visualize the median, quartiles, and outliers in the data. 

Violin plots have been used to show the distribution of continuous variables (mobile weight and talk time) across different price ranges. Violin plots are similar to box plots, but they also show the probability density of the data at different values. 

Shape 

2.Battery power, internal memory, and RAM have a positive relationship with price range. As the value of these features increases, the price range also increases. 

Screen height and width, pixel resolution height and width, and mobile weight do not have a clear relationship with price range. These features have a similar distribution across different price ranges. 

Talk time has a negative relationship with price range. As the value of talk time increases, the price range decreases. 

3. By analyzing the relationship between the target variable (price range) and various features (battery power, internal memory, RAM, screen height and width, pixel resolution, mobile weight, and talk time), businesses can better understand what features are important to customers when it comes to purchasing a mobile phone in different price ranges. 

This information can help businesses make informed decisions about product design, marketing, and pricing strategies. 

 

.Char3.- 

1. A bar chart helps to show the distribution of each category of the categorical variable and how it relates to the target variable. The use of multiple subplots in this code allows for easy comparison between the different categorical variables and their relationship with the target variable. 

Insights- 

2. Bluetooth: The majority of mobile phones in all price ranges have Bluetooth connectivity. However, the proportion of phones with Bluetooth is slightly higher in the higher price range. 

4G: Almost all mobile phones in the higher price range have 4G connectivity. In contrast, the proportion of phones with 4G is lower in the lower price range. 

Dual_sim: The majority of mobile phones in all price ranges have dual sim support. However, the proportion of phones with dual sim is slightly higher in the lower price range. 

3G: The majority of mobile phones in the lower price range have 3G connectivity, while the proportion of phones with 3G decreases as the price range increases. 

Business perspective- 

3. The majority of the devices in the higher price range have 4G connectivity, a business can leverage this insight by focusing on developing and marketing devices with 4G connectivity to cater to the high-end market segment. 

Similarly, if we observe that devices with dual sim are more popular in the lower price range, a business can focus on developing devices with dual sim to target the budget-conscious segment. 

 

 

Chart4- 

1.The pie chart is a good choice for this type of variable because it is a categorical variable with only two possible values ("yes" and "no"), and the pie chart can clearly show the proportion of each value in the dataset 

Insight- 

The chart shows that 51% of the mobile phones in the dataset have Dual sim feature while 49.1% do not have Dual sim feature. 

This may suggest that the presence or absence of Dual sim feature does not have a significant impact on the price range of mobile phones in the dataset. 

 

Business: 

It is not possible to determine whether the insights gained from this chart will have a positive or negative business impact without further context about the business problem and the specific goals of the analysis. 

Negative growth may arise if other variables in the dataset indicate decreasing sales, declining customer satisfaction, or increased competition, among other factors. It is important to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the entire dataset to identify potential areas of negative impact and take appropriate measures to address them.

Chart 7- 

1. This chart helps to understand the relationship between the binary features and the price range of mobile phones in the dataset. It can help to identify any trends or patterns between the two variables, which can be useful for making business decisions or developing predictive models 

Insights- 

The majority of mobile phones in the dataset support 4G, with only a small percentage not supporting it. 

There is a higher proportion of mobile phones in the high and very high price ranges that support 4G compared to the low and medium price ranges. 

Most of the mobile phones in the dataset also support 3G, with only a small percentage not supporting it. 

The distribution of mobile phones by price range is similar for those that support and do not support 3G. 

The chart suggests that having 4G support is more closely related to the price range of a mobile phone than having 3G support. 

Business- 

The relationship between the features and the price range can help mobile phone manufacturers make informed decisions about which features to prioritize and which ones to improve or eliminate to meet consumer demand. 

 

 

Chart8- 

1.it is a convenient way to visualize the distribution of a single variable, which can be helpful in identifying patterns and understanding the underlying structure of the data . 

The dashed lines at the mean and median values also provide information about the data's central tendency. 

Insights- 

We can see if a variable is normally distributed or if it has a skewed distribution. We can also see if there are any outliers in the data that may need to be addressed before building a predictive model. 

Business- 

The analysis shows that customers highly value battery life and camera quality, the company can focus on improving these features in their products to attract more customers and gain a competitive advantage. 

The analysis shows that customers are not interested in certain features, such as 3G connectivity, but the company continues to invest in these features, it may lead to negative growth. 

 

Chart9- 

The histogram is a good choice for this dataset because it allows us to visualize the distribution of the data for each variable. 

Insight- 

the Primary camera variable has a wider range of megapixels than the Front camera variable, as indicated by the spread of the histogram. 

This suggests that the primary camera on mobile phones tends to have a wider range of megapixels than the front camera. 

Business- 

if a mobile phone manufacturer decides to prioritize the front camera's mega-pixels over the primary camera's mega-pixels based on the above visualization, they might produce phones with high front camera mega-pixels but low primary camera mega-pixels. 

Mega-pixels alone do not determine camera quality, and other factors like sensor size and image processing algorithms also play a crucial role. 

 

 

Chart10- 

1.The KDE plot estimates the probability density function of the data and provides a smooth curve that highlights the shape of the distribution. 

The boxplot gives a quick visual summary of the distribution of the data and shows the median, quartiles, and any outliers in each price range. 

Insight- 

KDE: 

The distribution of Pixel_width varies across different Price_ranges. For example, high-end phones (Price_range 3) may have higher Pixel_width than low-end phones (Price_range 0). 

There may be overlap between the distributions of Pixel_width for different Price_ranges, indicating that Pixel_width may not be a strong predictor of Price_range on its own. BOX Plot: 

The median Pixel_width may differ across different Price_ranges. 

The interquartile range (IQR) of Pixel_width may differ across different Price_ranges, indicating that there may be different levels of variability in Pixel_width across different Price_ranges. 

The presence of outliers in Pixel_width may differ across different Price_ranges, indicating that there may be extreme values of Pixel_width that are more common in some Price_ranges than others. 

 

Business- 

This insight could help businesses prioritize investing in higher quality displays in their higher-end phones to differentiate themselves in the market.

Chart12- 

1.The KDE plot provides a visual representation of the density of weight values for each price range, allowing us to compare the distributions and identify any differences or similarities. 

Insight- 

The variable Mobile_weight is related to the price range of mobile phones. 

For example, if the KDE plot shows that the distribution of Mobile_weight is different for different price ranges, we can conclude that Mobile_weight is a significant variable in determining the price range of mobile phones. 

If the box plot shows that the median Mobile_weight decrease as the price range decrease, we can conclude that there is a negative correlation between Mobile_weight and price range. 

Business- 

If the weight of a phone becomes excessive, it may also turn off some consumers who prioritize portability and convenience, which could lead to negative growth for the manufacturer. 

 

 

Chart13- 

1. The chart includes a kernel density estimation (KDE) plot and a boxplot to explore the relationship between the screen size (sc_size) and the price range of the mobile phone. 

Insights- 

It appears that the sc_size distribution is higher for higher-priced phones (price range 2 and 3) compared to lower-priced phones (price range 0 and 1). 

Business- 

The analysis shows that larger screen size is associated with higher price ranges, a business might choose to prioritize larger screens in their product line. 

 

 

Chart14- 

1.The heatmap is a graphical representation of the correlation matrix that shows how strongly each variable is related to the other variables. 

Insights- 

Battery power, RAM, and price range have a strong positive correlation, which means that as the battery power and RAM of a phone increase, so does its price range. 

Internal memory, primary camera, pixel width, and screen height also have a moderate positive correlation with price range. 

The number of cores and talk time have a weak positive correlation with price range. 

Pixel height and screen width have a weak negative correlation with price range. 

RAM and internal memory have a strong positive correlation, which means that as the RAM of a phone increases, so does its internal memory. 

Pixel height and pixel width have a strong positive correlation, which means that as the pixel height of a phone increases, so does its pixel width. 

 

 

Chart15- 

1. Pair Plot generates pairwise scatter plots for all the variables in the dataset and allows us to see the relationships between variables, as well as the distribution of each variable  

Insights- 

The 'RAM' variable has a strong positive correlation with the 'Price_range' variable, which means that mobile phones with higher RAM tend to have higher price ranges. 

There is a weak positive correlation between the 'Battery_power' and 'Price_range' variables, which means that mobile phones with higher battery power tend to have slightly higher price ranges. 

The 'Pixel_height' and 'Pixel_width' variables have a positive correlation with each other, which is expected since higher pixel heights and widths typically result in better screen resolution. 

The 'Screen_height' and 'Screen_width' variables also have a positive correlation with each other, which means that mobile phones with larger screen heights also tend to have larger screen widths. 

There are no strong correlations between the other variables in the dataset.
